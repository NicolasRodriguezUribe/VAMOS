# Save and load run artifacts

VAMOS writes one relocatable canonical v1 directory for each run.

```python
import vamos

result = vamos.optimize(
    "zdt1",
    algorithm="nsgaii",
    pop_size=40,
    max_evaluations=400,
    seed=7,
)

stored = vamos.save_result(result, "runs/zdt1-seed-7")
loaded = vamos.load_result(stored.root)
run = vamos.load_run(stored.root)

print(stored.manifest.run_id)
print(loaded.F.shape)
print(run.status, run.environment["python"])
```

## Directory contents

```text
runs/zdt1-seed-7/
├── manifest.json
├── result.npz
└── environment.json
```

The manifest contains requested intent, resolved execution state, the actual
seed, provenance, outcome, artifact hashes, and a semantic self-hash. The NPZ
contains numerical result/population/archive arrays. The environment document
contains a bounded privacy-conscious runtime snapshot.

The directory may be moved as a unit. All references are relative and confined
to it. The destination passed to `save_result` must not exist; VAMOS never
overwrites or merges a run.

## Requested and generated seeds

An explicit seed, including zero, is used unchanged:

```python
result = vamos.optimize("zdt1", seed=0)
print(result.meta["seed"])  # 0
```

Pass `None` to ask VAMOS to generate a seed. Generation happens before any
stochastic execution object is constructed:

```python
result = vamos.optimize("zdt1", seed=None)
actual_seed = result.meta["seed"]
stored = vamos.save_result(result, "runs/generated-seed")

print(stored.manifest.requested_spec["defaults"]["seed"])  # None
print(stored.manifest.resolved_spec["seed"])                # actual integer
```

## Manual results

`OptimizationResult` instances created by `vamos.optimize` already carry their
complete run context. A manually constructed result must provide both the
requested and resolved specs:

```python
stored = vamos.save_result(
    manual_result,
    "runs/manual",
    requested_spec=requested_spec,
    resolved_spec=resolved_spec,
)
```

Without both mappings, saving raises `vamos.IncompleteRunMetadataError`. VAMOS
does not invent a seed or execution configuration from arrays.

## Loading and verification

Loading is data-only. It does not rerun optimization, resolve plugins, import
recorded custom components, use pickle, invoke a shell, or access the network.
Inspection and verification have the same inert trust boundary. Replay is an
explicit separate operation.

Verification modes are:

- `verify="manifest"`: validate manifest syntax, semantics, task ID, and
  self-hash;
- `verify="required"` (default): also verify artifacts required for loading;
- `verify="all"`: verify every known referenced artifact.

`load_run` returns an immutable manifest and lazy `.result`/`.environment`
access. `load_result` is the convenient numerical path. A failed run remains
inspectable through `load_run`, while `.result` raises `IncompleteRunError`.

## Inspect and verify

Inspect metadata without loading full arrays:

```bash
vamos results inspect runs/zdt1-seed-7
vamos results inspect runs/zdt1-seed-7 --json
```

The summary includes identity, problem/algorithm/backend, requested and
resolved seed, population/budget/outcome, array shapes/dtypes, replayability,
and lineage. It explicitly reports that full artifact verification was not
performed.

Full verification checks integrity, schema/path/NPZ safety, material
environment compatibility, built-in reconstructability, and effective
replayability as separate dimensions:

```bash
vamos results verify runs/zdt1-seed-7
vamos results verify runs/zdt1-seed-7 --require-level exact
```

The Python equivalent is:

```python
from vamos import verify_run

verification = verify_run("runs/zdt1-seed-7", require_level="exact")
print(verification.environment.level)
```

Exact compatibility requires matching VAMOS implementation content, Python
major/minor, material NumPy/SciPy/backend evidence, OS/architecture, BLAS, and
allowlisted thread controls. Missing material evidence does not qualify as
exact. Verification never installs or contacts anything.

## Exact built-in replay

```bash
vamos reproduce runs/zdt1-seed-7
vamos reproduce runs/zdt1-seed-7 --output runs/replays/zdt1-seed-7
```

Or from Python:

```python
from vamos import reproduce

replay = reproduce(
    "runs/zdt1-seed-7",
    output="runs/replays/zdt1-seed-7",
)
print(replay.exact, replay.output_root)
```

Replay never modifies the source. It creates a new canonical run, uses the
persisted resolved configuration and concrete seed, and never substitutes
current defaults. `F`, `X`, and deterministic auxiliary arrays are compared by
dtype, shape, logical order, and exact bytes. The new manifest stores bounded
source/root lineage and per-array comparison evidence.

This slice executes only same-environment, same-backend registered built-ins.
Custom Python, plugins, cross-backend execution, and best-effort environments
are outside the exact-replay contract, and it never installs dependencies. A pre-execution
refusal creates nothing; a failure after execution begins creates an inspectable
failed canonical attempt.

## Numerical safety and limits

NPZ loading always uses `allow_pickle=False`. V1 accepts fixed-width boolean,
integer, unsigned integer, and floating arrays. It rejects executable/object,
string, structured, complex, and datetime dtypes.

Readers validate bounded JSON, artifact count/size, ZIP member layout, NPY
headers, shapes, dtype, total elements/uncompressed bytes, and compression
ratio before materializing arrays. A trusted caller can explicitly provide a
different `vamos.LoadLimits`; limits are never raised automatically.

## Unsupported directories

VAMOS 1.x supports the public `vamos.run-manifest` `1.0.0` baseline. A directory
without that manifest is rejected with guidance to regenerate the run using the
current version. Schema `1.0.0` is the sole supported reader/writer path.

SHA-256 detects accidental modification; it is not a digital signature.
