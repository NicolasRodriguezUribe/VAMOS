\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are a default choice for black-box optimization problems with conflicting objectives, including engineering design and automated decision support.
Most MOEAs rely on a small number of variation operators (crossover and mutation) to balance exploration and exploitation.
However, operator choice is a major source of performance variability: operators that work well on one problem can stall on another, and the most effective operator can change as the population approaches the Pareto front.
This motivates \emph{adaptive operator selection} (AOS): selecting operators online based on feedback from the ongoing search, rather than relying on a single hand-tuned pipeline.

Most AOS mechanisms can be seen as two coupled components: (i) credit assignment (how to score an operator based on recent offspring) and (ii) an adaptation rule (how to turn scores into future operator-selection decisions).
Following the bandit view of AOS~\cite{dacosta2008aosdmab}, we model each candidate variation pipeline as an arm in a multi-armed bandit, and update an online policy from per-generation rewards.
Compared to offline tuning, this approach aims to improve robustness across problems and reduce the need for manual operator configuration.

This paper focuses on NSGA-II~\cite{deb2002nsgaii}, a widely used MOEA whose performance depends strongly on variation settings.
We implement a generation-level AOS layer for NSGA-II in a vectorized optimization framework and evaluate it on \AOSNProblems{} challenging benchmarks from the CEC\,2009 UF~\cite{zhang2009cec2009} and LSMOP~\cite{cheng2017lsmop} families---problems specifically designed to expose operator-choice sensitivity through curved Pareto sets and high-dimensional decision spaces.
Our evaluation reveals that AOS with Thompson Sampling dramatically outperforms the fixed baseline on these challenging landscapes, achieving +23\% higher mean HV overall and up to +80\% on large-scale problems.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
This paper makes four contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A simple, reproducible AOS interface for NSGA-II that selects exactly one variation pipeline per generation using Thompson Sampling with a sliding reward window.
  \item A reward design aligned with NSGA-II survivor selection, combining offspring survival and non-dominated insertion rates, with an optional bounded hypervolume-improvement proxy.
  \item A portfolio design based on parameter diversity (SBX $\eta$ variants) and structural diversity (BLX-$\alpha$, DE/rand/1/bin), showing that genuine operator diversity is the primary driver of performance gains on challenging landscapes.
  \item An empirical evaluation on \AOSNProblems{} challenging benchmarks (CEC\,2009 UF, LSMOP) demonstrating that AOS achieves +23\% higher mean HV than the fixed baseline, with \StatWinsBase{} statistically significant wins, while the diverse portfolio itself accounts for the majority of the improvement.
\end{itemize}
