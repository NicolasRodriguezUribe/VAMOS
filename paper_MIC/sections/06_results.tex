\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We first summarize solution quality and runtime at the family level (ZDT/\allowbreak DTLZ/\allowbreak WFG), then inspect per-problem deltas, convergence behavior, and operator usage.
Unless stated otherwise, we report medians over seeds.

\subsection{Solution quality}
Table~\ref{tab:hv_family} shows that AOS provides the largest benefits on the DTLZ family, while changes on ZDT are small and WFG shows a slight degradation on average.
Across all problems, AOS improves per-problem median hypervolume on \AOSWins{} out of \AOSNProblems{} problems, with the largest gain on \texttt{\AOSBestProblem{}} ($\Delta$=\AOSBestDelta{}) and the largest loss on \texttt{\AOSWorstProblem{}} ($\Delta$=\AOSWorstDelta{}).

\subsection{Runtime}
Table~\ref{tab:runtime_family} reports median runtime by family.
The median runtime overhead (overall) is \AOSRuntimeOverheadPct{}\%, which reflects extra policy updates, reward computation, and logging-related bookkeeping.
In settings where objective evaluations are expensive, this overhead is expected to be less pronounced in relative terms.

\subsection{Convergence and operator usage}
Figure~\ref{fig:anytime} shows convergence in normalized hypervolume for representative problems.
Figure~\ref{fig:usage} summarizes operator selection fractions by stage for the trace-exported problems.
We observe that on some problems the policy quickly locks into a single arm (e.g., SBX+PM), while on others it maintains diversity in operator usage (e.g., mixing SBX+PM with UNDX+Gaussian).
