    Test that Holm-Bonferroni correction saves a config that would be rejected

    """
    # Create 3 configs: Best, Borderline, Worst
    # Best: mean 1.0
    # Borderline: mean 0.9 (p ~ 0.04 vs Best)
    # Worst: mean 0.0 (p ~ 0.00 vs Best)

    # If alpha=0.05:
    # Naive: Borderline is rejected (0.04 < 0.05).
    # Holm-Bonferroni:
    #   p_values = [0.00, 0.04] (sorted)
    #   k=0 (worst): 0.00 < 0.05/2 = 0.025 -> Reject
    #   k=1 (borderline): 0.04 < 0.05/1 = 0.05 -> Reject?

    # Let's adjust values so Borderline is saved.
    # We need p_borderline > alpha / k_remaining
    # Suppose p_borderline = 0.03.
    # Alpha = 0.05.
    # Naive: 0.03 < 0.05 -> Reject.
    # Holm:
    # 2 hypotheses.
    # Worst: p=0.0001. 0.0001 < 0.05/2 = 0.025 -> Reject.
    # Borderline: p=0.03. 0.03 < 0.05/1 = 0.05 -> Reject... wait, this still rejects.

    # Ah, Holm-Bonferroni is step-down.
    # Rank 1 (smallest p): compare with alpha/m
    # Rank 2: compare with alpha/(m-1)

    # To demonstrate correction saving something:
    # We need p such that alpha/m < p < alpha.
    # But wait, step-down rejects IF p < threshold.
    # If p < alpha/m, we reject.
    # If we want to SAVE it (FAIL to reject), we need p > threshold.
    # So we need p > alpha/m BUT p < alpha (where naive would reject if it ignored multiplicity).

    # Example: alpha=0.05, m=2 comparisons.
    # Thresholds: 0.025, 0.05.
    # Config A: p=0.03.
    # Config B: p=0.04.
    # Naive: Both < 0.05 -> Reject both.
    # Holm:
    # Sorted: 0.03, 0.04.
    # 1. 0.03 < 0.025? False. Stop.
    # Result: NEITHER is eliminated. Both are saved!

    # Best: constant 1.0.
    # A: constant 1.0 - deltaA
    # B: constant 1.0 - deltaB
