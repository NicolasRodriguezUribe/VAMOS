\section{Threats to validity}
\label{sec:threats}

\paragraph{Portfolio dependence.}
Our conclusions depend on the chosen operator portfolio.
A different set of arms (or different parameterizations) could shift both the magnitude and direction of the observed effects.

\paragraph{Reward design.}
We use a simple reward based on survival and non-dominated insertion, with an optional hypervolume proxy.
More expressive credit assignment schemes (e.g., multi-step returns, per-offspring credit, or diversity-aware shaping) may produce different learning dynamics.

\paragraph{Benchmark scope.}
We evaluate on continuous engineering surrogates (RE and RWA suites) with 2--9 objectives and 3--10 decision variables.
Results may not transfer directly to constrained problems, discrete encodings, higher-dimensional search spaces, or real-world objectives with expensive evaluations where overhead amortization differs.

\paragraph{Runtime measurement.}
Runtime overhead is measured in a vectorized engine, making controller overhead more visible.
In other settings, the relative overhead of AOS may be smaller.
