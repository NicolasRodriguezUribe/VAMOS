## Graphical abstract (SwEvo / Elsevier)

Elsevier journals may request a separate graphical abstract file during submission.

If needed, a good starting point is reusing the framework architecture diagram:
- `paper/manuscript/figures/architecture.png`

Recommended export targets (check the journal submission portal requirements):
- one standalone image (e.g., PNG/PDF), no captions
- readable at thumbnail size
